# ImageConverter
This application was designed to convert between different types of image formats.
The main use case was to convert JPGs to PNGs as I came across problems displaying JPGs on a digital photo frame.

## How to use
Simply start the Main class which will open a command line where you can specify where you want to save the converted images and in which folder they are currently stored followed by the desired format.
